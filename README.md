    <h2>ðŸš€ About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello there! My name is Ivana Chipeja, a beginner programmer and Computer Science major. <br>
        I am currently learning Python and taking the Google Cybersecurity Certificate on Coursera. I also have some experience in HTML and CSS. I am interested in Back-End Development, App Development, Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence. I want to share my projects and contribute to Open Source. <br>
         Besides coding, I also like to listen to music, watch movies/TV and play games (especially The Sims).
